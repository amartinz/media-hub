  [ Sergio Schvezov ]
  * Repackaging from original music-hub.
  * Polishing packaging.
  * Enable the position property for getting the current playback
    position. Added duration to the dbus interface. Also added a service
    acceptance test for position and duration.
  * Make sure seek_to sends a reply to the client. Disabled
    position/duration test for now.

  [ Jim Hodapp ]
  * Modify directory structure to be generic media-hub instead of music-
    specific.
  * Added README file which describes how to build and how to run the
    tests. Also changed the namespaces to be the more general
    core::ubuntu::media instead of music-specific.
  * Removed com directory since it's no longer needed. All source under
    com was moved to core.
  * Removed com include directory since it's no longer needed. All
    source under com was moved to core.
  * Enable adding a videosink to the playbin pipeline. Added a couple of
    unit tests that test hardware decoding/software rendering, pause,
    play, seek and stop.
  * Added a very simple media-hub-server, which is the server side of
    the dbus MPRIS interface. Will fill this out more in the future to
    make it a full daemon.
  * Merged with EOS branch from tvoss. Added on_frame_available listener
    and callback. Create a decoding session and pass it to the hybris
    layer. Allow playback to work again after a client quits or dies.
    Added two new properties to see if the opened media is video or
    audio. Background playlist support. Add powerd control interface.
    One Engine instance per PlayerImplementation instance instead of one
    global Engine instance. Pause other playing sessions when starting
    playback of a new foreground player. Emit a PlaybackStatusChanged
    signal so that qtubuntu-media knows when PlaybackStatus changes from
    underneath it. Use GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT instead because seeking
    doesn't perform well enough with GST_SEEK_FLAG_ACCURATE .

  [ thomas-voss ]
  * Ramp up acceptance testing.
  * WIP.
  * Add stub and skeleton implementations.
  * Add first wave of acceptance tests and ensure that they are passing.
  * More refactoring of local spike.
  * More tests passing.
  * Add missing build dep on google-mock.
  * Add missing build-dependency on libgstreamer1.0-dev.
  * Add missing build dependencies.
  * Fix build dependencies on libboost-system-dev. Disable two failing
    tests.
  * Add build-dependency on libboost-program-options-dev.
  * Add fakesink for testing purposes.
  * Ensure that the audio sink is set to a fake sink for unit testing
    purposes.
  * Merged lp:~thomas-voss/media-hub/switch-to-properties-cpp

  [ Thomas Voß ]
  * Initial commit.
  * Added packaging setup.
  * Add backend and server implementation headers.
