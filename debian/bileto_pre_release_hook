# Script to generate debian files for dual landing in Vivid (gcc 4.9 ABI)
# and Wily and later (gcc 5 ABI).
#
# This script is called from debian/rules and generates:
#
# - control
# - libmedia-hub-client${MEDIA_HUB_SOVERSION}.install
# - libmedia-hub-common${MEDIA_HUB_SOVERSION}.install
#
# Because the debian files for the different distributions are generated on the fly,
# this allows us to keep a single source tree for both distributions.
#
